VPC endpoint uses instead of using NAT gatway because it is less costly and NAT Gatway is very costly...

  purpose of VPC endpoint---> without going to internet can access access private network 
                              VPC endpoint is free
                              VPC endpoint is a virtal device
                              Steps
                              Endpoint is specific-->
                              VPC endpoint is attached with private subnet
                            
same purpose ek instance me se dusra instance access krte hai
    LAB------------

Steps to attcah endpoint
          Step 1:   create VPC 
          inside vpc create 2 subnet 
                  * public subnet   
              
                  * private subnet (change the cidr )  -->

step 2: create internet gatway for both 
        igw-vpc1---->attacth with public subnet
        igw-vpc2---->attach with private subnet

step 3: create 2 route table
        public-route----->edit and connect public subnet--------->edit routes and provide igw  through this it go to the internet
        private-route---->edit and connect private subnet-------->


step 4: create 2 New Linux instance with using Custom VPC attach which I have created
        Note:  
              for attach private subnet EC2 do ---Disable--- Auto assign public IP (becasue ye internet pe nhi jaa skta)
              for attach public subnet EC2 do ---Enable--- Auto assign public IP 
                                                          

        Configure security group --> if windows instance use rdp, https, http --> source anywhere   for  inbound
        create a new key pay and downlaod 
        (we can use existing if one is created)

        * public server access krna hai putty ke through uske through private ke trough

Step 5: go to the Vpc dasboard
        click vpc endpoint
        click endpoint ----->create endpoint
                              search gateway--->s3-gatway
                              select 
                              choose custom VPC
                              choose subnet--->private subnet---->createendpoint
                              copy public instance ip-->on notepad
                              copy private instance ip-->on notepad
step 6: open putty gen
        choose insantace key
        save private key
        give name and save
open putty
give key 
connection-->auth-->credential--->give browse new saved key 
opened putty
write a command ---on linux-----> 
                                login as ec2-user
                                abc.pem
                                sudo su-
                                vi abc.pem
                                chmod 700 abc.pem
                                minimize the cmd
                                ssh -i abc.pem ec2-user@(copy that private IP server key and enter here)
                                go to the folder and that new key open with --notepad-->copy that key and pste in putty cmd
                                click escape and (wq) 


Now I have to access aws with vpc endpoint 
sudo su-
aws configure
now I have to give my access Id
                 * GO TO the aws account -->security credential---> ceate access key --> download that excel file 
                  and copy that open putty and paste it
                 * Now it ask for secret id Then I have to paste that excel file key 2nd 
                  enter
                  enter
                 * you are in your account
                  write cmd--aws s3 ls--> it gives nothing coz we don't have s3 bucket we have to create 
                 * go to the aws account -->inside s3 create a s3 bucket and 
                                          create --->cmd-->aws s3 mb://aditya342-->enter           (mb=make bucket)
                                          created
                  then check with write same cmd --> aws s3 ls
                  inside bucket I have to upload something-->click upload and choose from local storage and upload with pulic restriction
                  cmd-->aditya342-->enter
                  now check in cmd--> aws s3 ls-->that file shows in cmd
                  aws s3 remove s3 bucket aditya342

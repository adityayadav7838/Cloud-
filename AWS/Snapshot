It means just like scrrenshot 
EBS snapshot is take backup which is already completed or stored 

but not take snapshot which is currently running
and it can take time when create first snapshot.

aws account 5000 ebs volume can be created
and total 10000 snapshot can be taken

@ Note
ebs volune is AZ specific
snapshot is region specific like az1,az2,az3 

Q: if my ebs have 20gb and snapshot also 20 gb then if i will recreate ebs is it lesser then previous ebs?
ans: No we have to make Ebs volume SIZE CAN be same or larger then previous size no lesser.

~ if you have to take snapshot of root volume then first you have to stop the runnung instance then take snapshot otherwise it cannot be done


Incremental Snapshot---------------------->

how it works~~~~~
            EBS snapshot are stored incremently

          example: EBS [ A B C ] , Snapshot 1 [ A B `C` ] , Snapshot 2 [ C A B ] (C is edited in sap 1  add c at first in sap 2)

You charged for -- transfer data To s3 from your EBS volume you are taking snapshot
                    ~ snapshot stored in S3
                    ~ first snapshot is a clone and subsequent snapshot is incremental

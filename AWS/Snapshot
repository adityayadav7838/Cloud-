It means just like we take scrrenshot 
EBS snapshot is take backup which is already completed or stored 

but not take snapshot which is currently running
and it can take time when create first snapshot.

aws account 5000 ebs volume can be created
and total 10000 snapshot can be taken

@ Note
ebs volune is AZ specific
snapshot is region specific like az1,az2,az3 

Q: if my ebs have 20gb and snapshot also 20 gb then if i will recreate ebs is it lesser then previous ebs?
ans: No we have to make Ebs volume SIZE CAN be same or larger then previous size no lesser.

~ if you have to take snapshot of root volume then first you have to stop the runnung instance then take snapshot otherwise it cannot be done


Incremental Snapshot---------------------->

how it works~~~~~
            EBS snapshot are stored incremently

          example: EBS [ A B C ] , Snapshot 1 [ A B `C` ] , Snapshot 2 [ C A B ] (C is edited in sap 1  add c at first in sap 2)

You charged for -- transfer data To s3 from your EBS volume you are taking snapshot
                    ~ Snapshot stored in S3
                    ~ First snapshot is a clone and subsequent snapshot is incremental


HANDS-ON LAB: Create & Restore EBS Snapshot (AWS)

PART 1: Create EBS Snapshot

Step 1: Launch EC2 (if not already running)
            Go to EC2 > Launch Instance
            
            Choose Amazon Linux 2 (free tier)
            
            t2.micro → next steps → Name: test-snapshot
            
            In Storage section, you’ll see root volume (EBS), keep default (8 GB gp3)
            
            Launch instance

 Step 2: Connect to EC2 and Write Some Data
            Connect via SSH:
                        ssh -i your-key.pem ec2-user@<Public-IP>
            
            Create a test file:
            
                        echo "Hello from snapshot lab!" | sudo tee /data.txt
            
            
Step 3: Create Snapshot
            Go to EC2 > Volumes
            
            Find the volume attached to your instance
            
            Select it → Actions > Create Snapshot
            
            Name: snapshot-test
            
            Click Create Snapshot

~  Wait a few seconds → check under Snapshots

PART 2: Restore Volume from Snapshot

            Step 1: Create Volume from Snapshot
            Go to Snapshots
            
            Select your snapshot → Actions > Create Volume
            
            Choose same Availability Zone as your EC2
            
            Click Create Volume


Step 2: Attach New Volume to EC2
            Go to Volumes
            
            Select new volume → Actions > Attach Volume
            
            Choose EC2 instance
            
            Device name: /dev/xvdf → Click Attach

Step 3: Mount and Read Data
            Back to SSH terminal:
            
            bash
            Copy
            Edit
            lsblk     # Check if /dev/xvdf shows
            Mount the volume:

cmd----->
            sudo mkdir /mnt/snapshot
            sudo mount /dev/xvdf /mnt/snapshot
Read the file:

cmd------>
            cat /mnt/snapshot/data.txt

You should see: Hello from snapshot lab!


PART 3: Clean Up (Important to avoid charges)
cmd----->
            # On EC2 terminal
            sudo umount /mnt/snapshot

# In AWS Console:
- Detach and delete new volume
- Delete snapshot
- Terminate EC2 if no longer needed

Let me know — I can guide you to:

PART 1: Create a Snapshot of an Azure VM Disk

Step 1: Go to Your Virtual Machine
            Open https://portal.azure.com
            
            Go to Virtual Machines
            
            Select your VM (e.g., ubuntu-vm)
            
            Under Settings, click Disks
            
            Click the OS disk (e.g., ubuntu-vm_OsDisk_1_xyz)
            
            This will open the disk blade.


Step 2: Create a Snapshot
            On the disk page, click Create Snapshot
            
            Fill in:
            
            Name: snapshot-test
            
            Resource Group: (same as VM or new one)
            
            Snapshot type: Full (or Incremental for cost-saving)
            
            Storage type: Standard HDD (for testing)
            
            Click Review + Create → then Create
            
            This snapshot is now available under Snapshots in Azure.

PART 2: Restore Snapshot (Create Disk and New VM or Attach to Existing)

            Option 1: Create a New Disk from Snapshot
                        Go to Snapshots
                        
                        Click on your snapshot → Click Create Disk
                        
                        Fill in:
                        
                        Name: disk-from-snapshot
                        
                        Region: Same as original VM
                        
                        Size: Same or more than original
                        
                        Click Review + Create → then Create

            Option 2: Create a New VM from Snapshot Disk
                        Go to the newly created disk
                        
                        Click Create VM
                        
                        Choose:
                        
                        Region, VM size, username, and key
                        
                        Azure will launch a new VM with the same state as the snapshot.
                        
                        Useful for testing without disturbing the original VM.

             
            Option 3: Attach Snapshot Disk to an Existing VM (as Data Disk)
                        Go to your VM → Click Disks > Add data disk
                        
                        Click Create and attach a new disk
                        
                        Under Source type, choose Snapshot
                        
                        Select your snapshot
                        
                        Click Save
                        
                        SSH into the VM and mount it:

cmd----->
            # View new disk
            lsblk

            # Format and mount (if needed)
            sudo mkdir /mnt/snapdisk
            sudo mount /dev/sdc1 /mnt/snapdisk

            # Read contents (if snapshot had data)
            ls /mnt/snapdisk


Clean Up (Avoid Charges)
After testing, delete:

Unused Snapshots

Detached Disks

VMs (if only for testing)

Go to Resource Group > Delete Resource Group to delete all at once.

STEP 1: Create an S3 Bucket
        * Click "Create bucket".  
        * Enter a unique bucket name (e.g., my-demo-bucket-aditya).        
        * Choose your preferred AWS Region (e.g., Asia Pacific (Mumbai)).        
        * Leave other settings default for now (block public access should remain ON).
        * Click "Create bucket".      
        ~ Bucket created successfully!

STEP 2: Enable Versioning on the Bucket
        * Go to the S3 Dashboard and click on your bucket.        
        * Click the "Properties" tab.        
        * Scroll down to "Bucket Versioning".        
        * Click Edit → Select Enable → Click Save changes.        
        ~ Versioning is now enabled!
        
STEP 3: Upload a .txt File
        * Click the "Objects" tab in your bucket.
        * Click Upload → Add files.        
        * Choose a .txt file from your computer (e.g., test.txt).
        * Click Upload.
        ~File uploaded!


STEP 4: Upload Another Version of the Same File
        * Again click Upload → Add files.
        * Choose the same file (test.txt) but modify it first (change its content).
        * Upload it again with the same name (test.txt).
        ~ Now S3 has multiple versions of test.txt!

STEP 5: View File Versions
        * In your bucket, click "Objects" tab.        
        * Click "Show versions" (top-right toggle).        
        * You’ll see different versions of test.txt listed with Version IDs.

@Bonus Tips:
You can download old versions or restore deleted files using version IDs.

To delete a file, S3 just adds a "delete marker", it doesn't erase the actual version (because of versioning).

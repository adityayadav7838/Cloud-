 What is AWS Storage?
AWS offers scalable, durable, and secure storage services for a wide range of data types and use cases‚Äîfrom file storage to object storage, block storage, backups, and data archiving.

Types of AWS Storage & Their Use Cases:
1. Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) ‚Äì Object Storage
            Type: Object storage-->it store data as it is form
                                    we cannot install data in s3
                                    s3 bucket is a region specific
            
            Access: HTTP-based via REST API
            Durability: 99.999999999% (11 9s)
            Scalability: Virtually unlimited
            versionaing: it can do enable but not to do disbale(ou can do suspend but not disbale)
            
Use Cases:
            Store and serve static website files (HTML, CSS, JS)
            Backup and restore
            Application assets (images, videos)-->it is kind of folder bucket is a flat architecture it is not heirarchical
            Data lake (big data analytics)
            Software install packages
Rules of S3--
            bucket names is globaly unique
            bucket name are the part of url
            each number start with alphabet and end with alphabet

2. Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store) ‚Äì Block Storage
            Type: Block storage
            
            Attached To: EC2 instances
            Access: Like a local disk (mountable)
           
            Use Cases:
            
            Operating systems for EC2 instances
            Databases (MySQL, Oracle, etc.)
            Enterprise applications
            File systems


3. Amazon EFS (Elastic File System) ‚Äì File Storage
            Type: Network file system (NFS-based)

            Access: Multiple EC2 instances can access it simultaneously
            Scaling: Automatically scales as you add/remove files

            Use Cases:
            
            Shared file storage for applications           
            Web serving & content management           
            Lift-and-shift enterprise apps  
            Big data workloads


4. Amazon FSx ‚Äì Managed Windows & Lustre File Systems

a. FSx for Windows File Server
            SMB protocol

            Supports Windows-based applications

            Use Cases:
            Windows-based applications needing shared file storage

b. FSx for Lustre
          High performance, low latency
          
          Integrated with S3

Use Cases:

          Machine learning
          
          High-performance computing (HPC)
          
          Media rendering

5. AWS Backup
Centralized backup service for AWS services

Automates backups across EC2, RDS, DynamoDB, EFS, etc.

Use Cases:

Backup compliance

Disaster recovery

Centralized backup management

6. Amazon S3 Glacier & Glacier Deep Archive ‚Äì Cold Storage
Type: Long-term archival storage
        it is cheaper
Glacier: Retrieval in minutes to hours

Glacier Deep Archive: Lowest cost, retrieval in hours

Use Cases:

Compliance data storage (legal, healthcare)

Long-term backups

Archiving infrequently accessed data

7. AWS Storage Gateway
Connects on-premises systems to AWS cloud storage

Offers file, volume, and tape-based gateways

Use Cases:

Hybrid cloud storage

Backup and archiving from on-prem to cloud

Disaster recovery extension

8. Amazon DataSync
Transfers data between on-prem and AWS quickly and securely

Use Cases:

One-time or recurring data migrations

Automated data transfers

Backup/replication to cloud

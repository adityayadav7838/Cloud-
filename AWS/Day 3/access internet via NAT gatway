Step 1:   create VPC 
          inside vpc create 2 subnet 
                  * public subnet   
              
                  * private subnet (change the cidr )  -->

step 2: create internet gatway for both 
        igw-vpc1---->attacth with public subnet
        igw-vpc2---->attach with private subnet

step 3: create 2 route table
        public-route----->edit and connect public subnet--------->edit routes and provide igw  through this it go to the internet
        private-route---->edit and connect private subnet-------->


step 4: create 2 New instance with using Custom VPC attach which I have created
        Note:  
              for attach private subnet EC2 do ---Disable--- Auto assign public IP (becasue ye internet pe nhi jaa skta)
              for attach public subnet EC2 do ---Enable--- Auto assign public IP

        Configure security group --> if windows instance use rdp, https, http --> source anywhere   for  inbound
        create a new key pay and downlaod 
        (we can use existing if one is created)

Step 5: Connect both
      
        note : if I choose private instance for connect , if I downloaded the RDP of this I cannot accessed because I don't have its public IP

        select public instance 
            --> connect dowload rdp
            --> select get password 
            -->choose key which i have downloaded and decrypt the key 
              open the rdp paste password

Now what  I have to do from public subnet instance I have to acces the private subnet instance

step 6: inside public instance 
        open rdp 
        give priavte ip
        and password will be same for both
        then inside public insatnce I have accessed private  without using internet
        
      inside privte instance rdp open cmd
                    chcek is it accssed the internet of not
                    give command ------ ping 8.8.8.8 -t
                        if it gives output request time out then it means it cannot access the internet

      
what we have to do so it can access the internet
step 1: go to the services--> go to the VPC

step 2 : Click NAT gatway
        craete NAT gatway
        subnet of NAT gatway choose public (becoz NAT gatway always use with public subnet )
        create Elastic IP-->
        create NAT gatway
step 3:  go to the route table
        Go inside the private table--> edit routes and add route--->add ip 0.0.0.0/0 --> target -->NAT gatway
        saved
after that inside private vm cmd reply from internet comes

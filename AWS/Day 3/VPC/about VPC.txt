VPC is just like an virtual router
With Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC), 

you can launch AWS resources in a logically isolated virtual network that you've defined. 

This virtual network closely resembles a traditional network that you'd operate in your own data center, with the benefits of using the scalable infrastructure of AWS.

A Vixtual Yrivate Cloud is a Virtual Network
that Closely Resembles a traditional Networking

-Structure of AWS.

OR

VPC us a Virtual Network or Data Centre
inside AWS for One Client

It is logically Tsolated from Other Virtual
N/w in the AWS Cloud
> Max 5 VPC Can be Created and 200
Subnet in 1 VPC.

it can allocate max. 5 Elastic IP.
once We Created VPC, DHCP, NACL and
Security Group will be automaticalty
Created

A VPC is Confined to an AWs Region
and does not extend Between Regions.

# Types of VPC
   1. Default VPC -->   * Created in each AWS region when an AWS account is created 
			* Has a internet gatway by default
   
   2. Custom VPC---> creating the custom CIDR


Steps to Create a VPC
	1. create VPC	
	2. subnet
	3. Internet Gateway
	4. Route table

2. subnet 
*  If we have to check the subnet is public  then we have to check routing table 0.0.0/16


3. Internert gateway--->
* we can associate multiple  subnet in one route table
* but one subnet can associate with only one route at a time

NAT gatway (Network address translation)
* It transferred public Ip to private and private to public
* it attached inside vpc public subnet with this 
* it is works kind of midiator
* If we enable NAT 
* VPC par NACL lga hoga

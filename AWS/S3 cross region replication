Cross region replication means if you have two regions and you have upload something 
    * new data to one region then in your another region automatically upload that updated data
    * so it helps minimize latency

Soruce me kuch repli cate kiya to destination me add hoga 
but agar destinationn me kuch replicate kiya to source me add Nahi hoga 


What is Cross-Region Replication (CRR)?
Cross-Region Replication (CRR) is an Amazon S3 feature that automatically replicates objects from one bucket (source) in one AWS region to another bucket (destination) in a different region.

ðŸ”¹ Key Points:
        Requires versioning enabled on both buckets.        
        Replication is asynchronous.     
        Useful for disaster recovery, compliance, low-latency access, or backup.

Can replicate entire bucket or specific prefixes/tags.

Step-by-Step Guide to Set Up CRR (Cross-Region Replication)

Step 1: Create Two S3 Buckets in Different Regions
          Source Bucket:
          Go to S3 Dashboard â†’ Create bucket
          
          Name: my-source-bucket-aditya
          
          Region: Asia Pacific (Mumbai)
          
          Enable Versioning
          
          Create the bucket

Destination Bucket:
          Create another bucket
          
          Name: my-destination-bucket-aditya
          
          Region: US East (N. Virginia) (or any other)
          
          Enable Versioning
          
          Create the bucket

Step 2: Create an IAM Role for Replication (Optional if auto-generated)
          When creating replication rules, AWS can create the role automatically. But if you want to create manually:
          
          Go to IAM > Roles â†’ Create role
          
          Choose S3 as service
          
          Attach the AmazonS3FullAccess policy (or a custom one)
          
          Name the role: s3-replication-role

Step 3: Enable Cross-Region Replication
        Go to the source bucket
        
        Click on Management tab â†’ Replication rules â†’ Create replication rule


Step 4: Configure the Replication Rule
          Name the rule (e.g., replicate-to-us-east)
          
          Status: Enabled
          
          Choose Scope: Entire bucket (or filter by prefix/tag)
          
          Destination:
          
          Choose destination bucket: my-destination-bucket-aditya
          
          Choose destination region: US East (N. Virginia)
          
          IAM Role:
          
          Let AWS create the role automatically (recommended) or select your existing replication role
          
          Click Save/Submit
          
          CRR is now active!

Step 5: Test the Replication
          Upload a file (e.g., notes.txt) to source bucket
          
          After a few moments, check the destination bucket in the other region

@You should see the replicated file!
